Hi, I’m Hossein Khan Beigi. I’m a front-end developer with around eight years of experience building scalable, data-heavy web applications, mainly in fintech, security-focused products, and internal platforms.

Most of my recent work has been around complex dashboards, admin panels, and user-facing tools where performance, clarity, and reliability are critical. I usually work with React, Next.js, and TypeScript, and I care a lot about maintainable architecture, predictable state management, and clean data flows.

In my current role, I’ve been working on AI-powered front-end features such as intelligent dashboards, chat-based interfaces, and advanced onboarding flows. I collaborate closely with backend and AI teams to integrate LLM-based services, AI APIs, and data pipelines into usable, accessible interfaces. My focus is always on turning complex systems into experiences that feel simple and trustworthy for users.

I’m very comfortable working async. I prefer written communication, clear specs, and thoughtful reviews over constant meetings. I’ve led front-end teams and enjoy setting standards around code quality, documentation, and long-term scalability.

What I’m looking for next is work where front-end development goes beyond visuals and becomes a core part of product thinking. I’m especially interested in teams that value experimentation, strong collaboration between design and engineering, and building tools that people actually rely on.

Garden3d stood out to me because of its focus on creative technology, async culture, and high-quality work. I’m excited about contributing to projects where craft, technical depth, and collaboration really matter.

Thanks for watching, and I’m looking forward to connecting.
