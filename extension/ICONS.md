# Icon Files Needed

You need to create three icon files for the extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can:
1. Create simple icons with any image editor
2. Use online icon generators
3. Use placeholder images for now (the extension will work without them, just won't show an icon)

For a quick placeholder, you can create simple colored squares with text "STT" (Speech to Text).
